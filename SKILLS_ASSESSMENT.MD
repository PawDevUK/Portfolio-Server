# Portfolio Server — Skills Summary & Job-Readiness Report

This report summarizes the technical and professional skills demonstrated by the Portfolio-Server project, maps those skills to code evidence in the repository, and gives a concise assessment of job readiness plus prioritized next steps to improve hireability.

## Quick assessment
- Current level: Approaching junior → junior+ (good for entry-level backend roles; with improvements could target stronger junior/mid positions).
- Strengths: Node.js backend fundamentals, routing and modular code organization, date/time logic, and data transformation skills.
- Main gaps to address: testing coverage, robustness (error handling & validation), modern date libraries/updates, and developer ergonomics (linting, CI, documentation).

---

## Technical skills demonstrated
- Node.js (CommonJS modules, module.exports)
  - Evidence: multiple `require` / `module.exports` across routes and factory modules.
- Express.js basics (Router, route mounting)
  - Evidence: `router = require('express').Router();` and route wiring in `Tracker.js`.
- JavaScript (ES5/ES6 mix, functions, objects, arrays)
  - Evidence: factory functions, higher-order usage, array transforms, destructuring in parts of code.
- Date/time handling and business rules
  - Evidence: heavy use of Moment.js in `calculate.js` for shift calculations, rate boundaries, cutoffs and pay-day logic.
- Algorithmic problem solving
  - Evidence: complex pay-hour split (day/night/weekend), pay-day/cutoff calculations, monthly/year aggregation.
- File I/O & JSON manipulation
  - Evidence: writing full-year payloads (`writeFullYear`), reading store JSON (`fullYearCalendar.json`), building calendar objects.
- Modular design / separation of concerns
  - Evidence: `factory` modules for calendar creation, calculations, development helpers; `store` for constants; routes / router.
- NPM & environment config
  - Evidence: `require('dotenv').config()` usage and project structure implies package management.
- Basic debugging & development tooling awareness
  - Evidence: commented logs and development helpers (e.g., `development` factory functions).

## Soft / process skills
- Problem decomposition: splitting calendar, payday, overtime logic into functions.
- Iterative development: commented TODOs and experimental code for overtime adjustments.
- Code readability effort: named functions, consistent object shapes.

---

## Risks / issues found (high-impact)
- Moment.js is used (legacy library). Consider migrating to date-fns or Luxon for future maintenance.
- Little to no error handling/validation in many public functions (could produce runtime exceptions with bad inputs).
- Missing or low test coverage (unit tests / integration tests not present).
- Some functions mutate objects and use implicit shared state (could produce bugs when reused).
- Magic numbers (9.25, percent values, hard-coded pay day) and inconsistent naming can cause maintenance issues.
- Hard-coded FirstPayDay and file-writing at module load — side effects during import make testing and reuse harder.
- Inconsistent return types: some values are null, some numbers — make shapes consistent.
- No linting/formatting, no TypeScript, no CI, no Docker — reduces employer confidence for production-readiness.

---

## Job-readiness score (practical)
- Junior backend (intern / entry-level): 70% — likely to get interviews if you can demonstrate understanding.
- Junior → Junior+: 55–65% — needs tests, better error handling, documentation, and small refactors.
- Mid-level: 30% — would need stronger architecture, typing (TS), CI/CD, testing, and security awareness.

---

## Prioritized next steps (recommended)
1. Add unit tests (Jest/Mocha) for core pure functions:
   - Test: `getHoursFromStart`, `calcEarnedForDay`, `calcPayDay`, `reduceFloat`, `findCutOfDays`.
2. Remove side effects on import:
   - Avoid writing files as part of module load; expose functions and call them from a script/entry point.
3. Add input validation and defensive checks (throw/return informative errors).
4. Replace Moment.js (or wrap it) — migrate to date-fns or Luxon for new code.
5. Introduce linting & formatting (ESLint + Prettier) and a consistent style.
6. Add README and API docs (endpoints, data shapes, example output).
7. Add CI (GitHub Actions) to run tests and lint on push.
8. Consider TypeScript for stronger typing (gradual migration possible).
9. Containerize/app-level startup script (Dockerfile, start script) and document how to run locally.
10. Add logging and metrics (console → structured logs or pino/winston).

## Interview / CV bullet points (short, copyable)
- Implemented a Node.js + Express backend that generates shift calendars and computes pay across day/night/weekend/overtime rules.
- Designed date/time algorithms to split shifts across rate boundaries and monthly pay cutoffs.
- Built modular code: calendar factory, calculation functions, and development utilities; used JSON stores and file outputs.
- Used Moment.js (date handling), implemented pay aggregation and earnings calculations.
- Added developer tooling for producing full-year JSON exports used for front-end consumption.

---

## Suggested short-term tasks (2–7 days)
- Write unit tests for 10–15 core cases (cover edge cases around midnight/weekend boundaries).
- Stop writing files on import; move `writeFullYear()` call to a small CLI script (`scripts/generate-year.js`).
- Add a README with quickstart: install, run tests, run server, generate outputs.

## Suggested medium-term tasks (2–4 weeks)
- Migrate from Moment.js to date-fns or Luxon.
- Add TypeScript or at least JSDoc types for public module APIs.
- Add CI pipeline and lint/prettier rules.

---

If you want, I can:
- create the suggested README and CLI script,
- scaffold Jest tests for core functions,
- add ESLint & Prettier config,
- or convert one file from Moment to date-fns as a migration example.

Which of the above would you like me to generate
