# Work Tracker

    App to record work hours and generate earnings.
    At the moment application:
    - Gets start time and calculate earnings for the day based on the rate and extra shift allowance.
    - Gets rota combination and calculate days at work.
    - Returns object representation of full year with days at work, of days, earnings.

## Application Overview

**A full-stack work hours tracking and payroll calculation system built with Node.js/Express.js backend and React frontend.**

### Core Functionality

This application is designed to track work hours and automatically calculate earnings for employees working irregular shift patterns. The system handles complex payroll calculations with multiple rate structures and generates comprehensive monthly and yearly earnings reports.

### Key Features

**üìÖ Flexible Work Scheduling**
- Supports irregular weekly work rotas (e.g., Mon-Tue-Fri-Sat-Sun combinations)
- Handles multiple yearly rotation schedules (2022-23, 2023-24, 2024-25)
- Tracks off-days and working days with customizable patterns

**üí∞ Advanced Payroll Calculations**
- **Base Rate**: ¬£18.02/hour (current rate, with historical rates tracked)
- **Night Shift Premium**: +25% (¬£22.52/hour)
- **Weekend Premium**: +30% (¬£23.97/hour) 
- **Overtime Premium**: +50% (¬£27.03/hour)
- Automatic calculation of earnings based on shift start times and duration

**‚è∞ Intelligent Time Management**
- Uses Moment.js for precise date/time calculations
- Calculates shift hours across different rate periods (day/night/weekend)
- Handles shifts that span multiple days and rate zones
- Tracks paydays and cut-off dates for payroll periods

**üìä Comprehensive Reporting**
- Generates full yearly calendars with detailed daily breakdowns
- Monthly earnings summaries with rate-specific calculations
- Pay period calculations between paydays
- Overtime tracking and integration into payroll

### Technical Architecture

**Backend (Node.js/Express.js) - ~90% Complete**
- RESTful API with Express.js routing
- MongoDB integration (schema defined, currently commented out)
- User authentication system (login/register routes)
- Modular architecture with separate calculation, calendar, and development utilities
- JSON data persistence for work rotas and earnings calculations

**Frontend (React.js) - ~20% Complete**
- Located in separate `portfolio-react` directory
- User interface for work schedule management
- Earnings visualization and reporting interface

**Data Management**
- Historical work rotation data (2022-2025)
- Rate progression tracking (¬£14.98 ‚Üí ¬£16.75 ‚Üí ¬£18.02)
- Pre-calculated yearly calendars with earnings data
- User profile management with calendar assignments

### Use Cases

- **Employee Self-Service**: Track personal work hours and view earnings
- **Payroll Processing**: Automated calculation of complex shift-based pay
- **Schedule Management**: Handle irregular work patterns and rotations  
- **Financial Planning**: Yearly and monthly earnings projections
- **Overtime Management**: Track and calculate overtime premiums

### Current Development Status

The backend logic is highly mature with sophisticated algorithms for:
- Multi-rate hour calculations across day/night/weekend boundaries
- Payroll period management and cut-off date handling
- Calendar generation with earnings integration
- Database schema design for user and calendar data

The frontend is in early development stages, with the backend API ready to support full-featured React components for schedule management and earnings visualization.

This application demonstrates advanced payroll calculation logic suitable for businesses with complex shift patterns, multiple pay rates, and irregular work schedules.

## Questions

- What should be base calendar object.
    There shouldn't be base calendar object.
    Every calendar object should be unique for every user.
- How calendar object should be initialized ?
    User should on the client side choose rota and start time and then send request to the back-end to generate calendar object and then save it in the DB. This calendar object should be assigned to the user.
- Where should be stored based calendar object.
    There should be uniq calendar object for every user. It should be initialized for every new user and then updated every single time when user add:
    - extra time/overtime.
    - extra days
    - absence day at work.
- User should has in the DB:
    - username.
    - email.
    - password.
    - uuid.
    In the case of user not being in the DB, they should be added to the db with the uuid.
- What should be a structure of DB for all app ?
    App for sure needs object with users and assigned to them calendar objects.
    [
        {
            user: topmax12,
            email:sfsf@fs.com,
            password:12233,
            calendar:[]
        }
    ]

## ToDo

- [ ] test addOvertimesToPayDay.
- [ ] add login route to WorkTracker.
- [ ] add register route to WorkTracker.
- [ ] connect backend to mongo DB.
- [ ] test connection to DB and schema.
- [ ] functionality to save new user without calendar.
- [ ] functionality to get user with calendar object.
- [ ] functionality to check if user exist.
- [ ] add DB to save user obj with calendar obj.
- [ ] count weekdays, fridays, saturdays, sundays.
- [ ] add counted days to calendar object.
- [ ] functionality to update user credential.
- [ ] Add test to check all week, 7 days and 24h for every day in the week to check start time. Test should loop over 24 hours and check if sum of the hours is 9.25.
- [ ] Test earnings from selected start time.
- [ ] Refactor getNameOfWeekDay as it probably can be one liner.
- [ ] Refactor calcPercent and add to this function "reduceFloat" to avoid repeating use of "reduceFloat".
- [ ] Add functionality to extractDateFromString to extract year/month (at the moment extracts month/year) and return in correct form for moment js. Functionality need detect where year is passed, as a first or as a second argument.
- [ ] Reduce getNameOfWeekDay by moving this function below returnDate and pass only date argument which has correct day and time.

- [x] Add functionality to calculate day,evening,weekend hours for different starts for Saturday.
- [x] Add functionality to calculate day,evening,weekend hours for different starts for Sunday.
- [x] Add test to function calcEarnedForDay to check changes.
- [x] Add test to function returnDate.
- [x] Fix issue in the returnDate which is failing to return correct date with time in case of string "01/02/2022 22:00".
- [x] Crete functionality in the returnDate to take argument date as a string and the array with the string.
- [x] IMPORTANT !!!! Check functions for potential problem with mutation of moment object as it is mutable and every use of moment methods changes initial object !!!!
- [x] Add test to function returnDate.
- [x] Add test to function extractDateFromString.
- [x] Add functionality to returnDate date argument to pass in the array days or days,hours or days,hours,minutes.
- [x] Merge returnDate and getFullDate.
- [x] Fix issue with startTime default value.
- [x] Check if monday earnings calculation is correct for fixed 17:00.
- [x] Create functionally to calculate finish basic based on start time.
