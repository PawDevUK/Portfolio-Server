# Development Timeline

## 19/10/25

**Vercel Deployment** - Converted Express app to serverless and deployed successfully to Vercel. Fixed "writeFullYear is not a function" error by correcting function imports. **Resolved git merge conflicts** in createCalendar.js and Tracker.js files, removing all conflict markers and fixing syntax issues. Added development configuration files (launch.json, nodemon.json) and skills-tools.md documentation. **Major code cleanup** including proper JSDoc formatting and elimination of module-level execution issues.
